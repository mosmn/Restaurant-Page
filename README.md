- Webpack

## Approach
The approach for this project was to create a restaurant website with dynamic content and tabbed browsing. The project was divided into the following steps:

1. **Basic Structure**: Initially, the focus was on creating the basic structure of the web pages using HTML and CSS. This included designing the layout, adding necessary elements, and styling them appropriately.

2. **Dynamic Content**: To make the website interactive and dynamic, JavaScript was used to create and manipulate the content. JavaScript modules were utilized to separate the code into manageable components. A page-load function was implemented to generate and append the initial content to the `div#content` element.

3. **Tabbed Browsing**: Tabbed browsing functionality was implemented to navigate between different sections of the website. Separate modules were created for each tab, containing the logic to generate the respective content. Event listeners were added to the tab buttons to switch between tabs and update the content dynamically.

4. **Deployment**: For deploying the website, GitHub Pages was utilized. The bundled version of the site generated by webpack was pushed to the `dist` folder, and the necessary configuration was set up in the repository's settings.

## Challenges
The project presented several challenges during its development:

- **Dynamic Content Generation**: Creating and manipulating content dynamically using JavaScript required a deep understanding of DOM manipulation and the ability to work with object-oriented programming concepts.

- **Tabbed Browsing**: Implementing the tabbed browsing functionality involved handling event listeners, updating the content based on user interactions, and managing the state of active tabs.

- **Code Organization**: Structuring the code in a readable and maintainable way was important. It required careful consideration of module separation and following best practices for code organization.

## Future Features

- Implementing a gallery page to showcase images of the restaurant's interior and dishes.
- Incorporating an online ordering system to enable customers to place food orders for delivery or pickup.
- Integrating a review section where customers can leave feedback and ratings for the restaurant.
- Including a map and directions section to help customers locate the restaurant easily.
